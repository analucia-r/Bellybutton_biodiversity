# Plotly 
## Purpose of this project
With the work we did in the module Roza has a partially completed dashboard but she needs to finishs. We've created tree types of charts for the completed panel visualizing the bacterial data for each volunteer with a Bar Chart, Bubble Chart and a Guage Chart.. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Summary 
With these results Roza will be able to present to her partners at Improabable Beef about her findings. They can use this information to have an effective production of sunthetic beef.
